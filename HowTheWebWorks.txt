* What happens when you type a URL in a browser?
- URL is parsed. Web browser breaks down the URL in to protocol, domain name, path, query paramenters, and fragment identifier.
- DNS resolution. Uses the domain name to find the IP address.
- Establishes a connection. 
- Sends an HTTP request. Once a connection is made, the web browser sends a request to the server.
- Server sends a response.
- Receives and renders the response. The browser processes the response from the server. Includes sending more request to finish
  rendering the webpage.
